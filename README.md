# Mirror Clip

This mirror clip bounces the light from the TrueDepth camera 90 degrees to make it easier to scan world-facing objects.

This clip is built to work with [Capture](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/capture-3d-scan-anything/id1444183458?mt=8), available for free on the iOS App Store.

The clip also works with Standard Cyborg's iOS Scanning SDK. [Full documentation](https://standardcyborg.com/docs/cocoa-api)

*Note: full support for Capture and the iOS SDK coming this week. Currently models will be flipped left/right.*

## Device Support
The current clip supports the iPhone X. We will release clips for the iPhone Xs, iPhone Xr, iPhone Xs Max, and iPad Pro (2018) soon.

## Printing Suggestions
- This design requires high dimensional accuracy.
- As a result: FDM is not recommended.
- We recommend multijet fusion, SLA, or SLS.

## The Mirror
We built this clip to work with this mirror from Edmunds optics: [25.4 x 35.4mm, 4-6Î» Mirror](https://www.edmundoptics.com/p/254-x-354mm-4-6lambda-mirror/26617/). The mirror is rated to a certain flatness and has a First Surface Mirror (FSM) on one side. A First Surface Mirror is desirable to prevent refraction through the 3mm glass. The mirror comes with a blue film on the FSM you will need to remove. FSMs can scratch, so treat it with respect!

## Use
- The slot is just thick enough to slide the mirror in and hold it without additional friction.
- If you want to further secure the mirror, you can superglue the back. We do suggest you think through transporting to keep the unit safe if you decide to do this.
